  Introduction to Dart
  Dart is a modern, object-oriented, strongly typed programming language developed by Google. 
  It is designed for building fast, scalable, and cross-platform applications, particularly mobile, web, and desktop applications.

  Dart follows familiar programming paradigms such as:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Functional Programming
  - Asynchronous Programming using async/await 

  Key Features of Dart:
  1. Strongly typed with sound null safety
  2. Class-based and object-oriented
  3. Supports JIT (Just-In-Time) and AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation
  4. Clean, readable syntax (similar to Java, C++, and JavaScript)
  5. Excellent support for asynchronous programming

  Why Dart?
  1. Used with Flutter (Single Codebase)
  Dart allows developers to write one codebase and deploy it to:
    1.1 Android
    1.2 iOS
    1.3 Web
    1.4 Windows, macOS, Linux
  This significantly reduces development time and cost.

  2. High Performance
    2.1. AOT compilation converts Dart code into native machine code.
    2.2. Results in fast startup time and smooth UI performance.
    2.3. No JavaScript bridge is required in Flutter apps.

  3. Easy to Learn
  Dart syntax is simple and familiar for developers with knowledge of:
    3.1 Java
    3.2 C
    3.3 JavaScript
  Example:
    void main() {
      print("Hello Dart");
    }
  
  4. Strong Null Safety
  Dart prevents null reference errors at compile time, making applications more reliable and less prone to crashes.
  int? x;   // nullable
  int y = 10; // non-nullable

  5. Excellent Asynchronous Support
  Dart handles asynchronous operations cleanly using Future, async, and await.
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    print("Data loaded");
  }

  6. Hot Reload (Developer Productivity)
  With Flutter and Dart:
    6.1 Code changes reflect instantly
    6.2 No need to restart the application
    6.3 Speeds up UI development and debugging

  7. Backed by Google & Growing Ecosystem
    7.1 Actively maintained by Google
    7.2 Strong community support
    7.3 Thousands of packages available via pub.dev

  Where Dart Is Used
   * Mobile apps (Flutter)
   * Web apps (Flutter Web, Dart Web)
   * Desktop apps
   * Server-side applications
   * CLI tools
  
  Conclusion
  Dart is chosen because it combines:
   * Performance
   * Safety
   * Simplicity
   * Cross-platform capability
  It is especially powerful when used with Flutter, making it an excellent choice for modern application development and a strong skill for computer science students and developers.
